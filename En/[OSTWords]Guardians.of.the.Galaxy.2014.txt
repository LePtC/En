又大又新鲜的洞

-老子才不买你的账  -我倒数五下
- I ain't buyin' it. - I'm giving you to the count of five.

已经谈拢了  我们没事了
We figured it out! We're fine!

要从那群把我们
We're gonna rob the guys

打得屁滚尿流的家伙手里抢东西
who just beat us senseless.

我们又没空考虑倒数时间
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae

那些细节
of the plan.

我们为朋友两肋插刀就这下场
This is what we get for acting altruistically.

她说得没错  你没有发表意见的权利
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

没错  生活本来就是付出比回报更多
And, usually, life takes more than it gives.

可今天不是
But not today.

今天我们得到了眷顾
Today, it's given us something.

生活给了我们一个机会
It has given us a chance.

什么机会
To do what?

去拼一回
To give a shit.

仅此一回
For once.

不要逃避
Not run away.

罗南要屠杀无数无辜的生命
I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch

而我  绝不会袖手旁观
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.

我活了这么久  只跟敌人打过交道
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.

我愿意和朋友共生死
I will be grateful to die among my friends.

你是个有担当的男人  奎尔
You are an honorable man, Quill.

我愿意跟你并肩作战
I will fight beside you.

随你们吧  反正本来我也活不长
What the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

我也站起来了  你们满意了吧
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

现在我们都站起来了
We're all standing up now.

一群傻缺  站成个圈圈
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.

宝石会对任何有机体产生反应
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

目标越大  威力越强
The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.

罗南只需要让宝石
All Ronan's got to do is

接触到星球的表面  它就会毁掉一切
touch the Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

所有的植物  动物
All plants, animals,

-新星军团  -一切都将被毁灭
- Nova Corps. - Everything will die.

所以不能让罗南登陆
So Ronan does not make the surface.

火箭带领一队人马在暗黑星号右舷
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

轰开一个洞
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

这样我们和勇度的飞船就可以攻进去了
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

里面有上百个萨卡士兵把守吧
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

萨卡士兵都是纸做的
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

他们一旦得知我们登陆了
Once they know we're on board,

罗南会关上舱内的安全门
Ronan will isolate himself

把自己隔离起来
behind impenetrable security doors on deck.

我可以通过破坏动力系统解锁
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.

接着我们进到驾驶舱
We'll make it to the flight deck,

用强子枪把罗南轰上天
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.

罗南一死我们就回收宝石
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.

记得要把它装进这些装置里
Use these devices to contain it.

已发现罗南舰队
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,

预计十五分钟后抵达
and will arrive in T-minus fifteen minutes.

敢耍我就砍死你们
You cross me, we kill you all.

一个掠夺者刚刚给我传达了一则消息
I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers.

他说罗南得到了一颗什么无限宝石
He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone

正冲着山达尔来
and he's headed toward Xandar.

我是新星军团的丹纳利安·萨尔
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.

先声明一下  我始终认为不该相信你
For the record, I advised against trusting you here.

看来我的"混蛋"消息他们收到了
They got my "Dick" Message!

用事实证明我错了吧
Prove me wrong.

右舷核心部位受创
The starboard kern has been breached!

他们闯进来了
We have been boarded.

继续向前推进
Continue our approach.

但是新星军团也掺合进来了
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

着陆之后一切就都不是问题了
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.

关闭所有安全门
Seal security doors!

所有新星飞行员听令
All Nova pilots,

全体对接形成封锁网
interlock and form a blockade.

务必阻止暗黑星号着陆
The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.

已锁入
Locked in!

感谢你们  不在意我的鲁莽之举
I am grateful for your acceptance

依然接受我
after my blunders.

再次有朋友相伴的感觉...
It is pleasing to once again have...

真棒
friends.

这颗蠢树也是我朋友
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

还有这个绿婊子也
And this green whore, she, too...

给我闭嘴
You must stop!

卡魔拉  看看你干的好事
Gamora, look at what you have done.

你还是一如既往的软弱
You have always been weak.

愚蠢  背信弃...
You stupid, traitorous...

不要这么跟我朋友说话
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

够了  死灵舰队飞行员

丹纳利安·萨尔  需要解除连锁吗
Denarian Saal, should we break formation?

不行  保持阵形
No! Hold your positions.

拖住罗南  萨尔
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

下面市民的安全交给我们了
We'll take care of the people down here.

我居然要听命于一只小仓鼠
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.

山达尔
Xandar!

接受制裁吧
You stand accused.

可悲的和平条约也救不了你们了
Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now.

跟条约一起葬身火海吧
It is the tinder on which you burn.

之前我错了
I was mistaken.

我确实记得你家人
I do remember your family.

她们临死时的叫声
Their screams were

那么可悲  我
pitiful. I...

看吧
Behold!

看这支银河护卫队
Your guardians of the galaxy.

你们护卫了什么
What fruit have they wrought?

现在我终于得偿所愿
Only that my father and his father

为我父亲和爷爷报了仇
shall finally know vengeance.

山达尔的子民
People of Xandar,

背弃你们卑微的信仰
the time has come to rejoice

迎接我的时刻到了
and renounce your paltry gods!

你们即将得到救赎
Your salvation is at hand.

用力舞起来
Now bring it down hard!

你在干嘛
What are you doing?

比舞啊  老兄  就我们俩
Dance-off, Bro. Me and you.

委婉拒绝  收回邀请
Subtle. Take it back.

你到底在搞什么鬼
What are you doing?

分你的心啊  大蠢蛋
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.

你们只是凡人
You're mortal!

怎么可能
How?

你不是说过吗  婊子
You said it yourself, bitch.

我们可是银河护卫队
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

不错  不错
Well, well, well.

好一场光影盛宴
Quite the light show.

大团圆结局啊
Ain't this sweet.

不过在你们嘿咻嘿咻之前
But you got some business to attend to

先给我把正事办了
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

都说我长得像菩萨
I may be as pretty as an angel,

可我没有菩萨心肠
but I sure as hell ain't one.

快交给我吧  孩子
Hand it over, son.

奎尔这小子还挺懂事
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

当初没有按他爹的要求把他送过去
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad

也许是个正确的决定
like we was hired to do.

是啊  他爹就是个混球
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

等他发现宇宙灵球被我掉包了
He is gonna be so pissed when he realizes

非气炸不可
I switched out the Orb on him.

有一半血统来自地星
You are half Terran.

你母亲是地球人  至于你父亲
Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well,

他是某种我们从未接触过的远古生灵
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.

怪不得
That could be why

你握着宝石那么久却没事
you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

你的朋友们来齐了
Your friends have arrived.

我谨代表新星军团
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

向你们致以最真诚的谢意
we'd like to express our profound gratitude

谢谢你们拯救了山达尔

你们可以跟随丹纳利安·戴

谢谢了  新星至尊
Thank you, Nova Prime.

你帮妻女报了仇

现在她们能安息了
knowing that you have avenged them.

我们想保留它原本的样子
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.

已经尽全力做了相关修复了

多亏你她们才能活下来

你们的犯罪记录已经被抹掉了

（vt.  擦掉;除去;删去;消除）

不过还是得提醒你们
However, I have to warn

遵纪守法才是好公民
you against breaking any laws in the future.

问一下
Question.

如果我拿了一件很想要的
What if I see something that I want to take,

刚好又属于别人的东西呢
and it belongs to someone else?

你会被逮捕
You will be arrested.

可如果我比物主更想要那东西呢
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?

-还是违法的  -说不通啊
- It's still illegal. - That doesn't follow.

我更想要啊  长官  你懂吗
No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand?

笑什么
What are you laughing at?

干嘛拉我走  我不能和这位先生聊聊吗
Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman?

如果谁把我惹毛了
What if someone does something irksome

然后我决定要抽了他的脊椎呢
and I decide to remove his spine?

那个
That's...

那个应该算谋杀了
That's actually murder.

最恶劣的犯罪之一
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

所以  也是违法的
So... also illegal.

他们会老实待着的  戴
They'll be fine, Dey.

我会看好他们的
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

你
You?

对啊  我
Yeah. Me.
